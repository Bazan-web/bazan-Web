<h2> Attack </h2>
<p><br>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be spearers or smashers.</p>
<p><br>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious
damage on victims larger than themselves. </p>
<h2> Eyesight </h2>
<p><br>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p><br>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
